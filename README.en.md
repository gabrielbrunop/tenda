## Overview

**Tenda** is a programming language designed for native Portuguese speakers. Its primary goal is to make programming more accessible by using Portuguese keywords and a syntax that reads like natural language. This narrative-style approach aims to lower the barrier to entry for beginners and educators in Portuguese-speaking communities.

While Tenda is tailored for Portuguese syntax and semantics, it draws inspiration from modern programming paradigms and emphasizes readability and expressiveness. It's particularly suited for educational purposes, allowing learners to grasp programming concepts without the added complexity of a foreign language.
